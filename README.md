It Scans Open Ports of TCP Ports For Particular IP Address And Generates Report
[With NMap and Without NMap]

## WORKING Without NMap:

Here Given the main Scripts known as "scan.pl" and "scan1.pl".Download it.

Now, we have to make file "ip.txt" in which we have to mention IP Addresses in Ipv4 32 bit format.

This Script Generates the Report for Particular IP which you want to Scan Ports,
And Helps you to See which Ports are Listening/Not Listening/Open On That Particulat IP Address.
